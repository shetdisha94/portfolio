          I am a developer by passion with a keen interest in technology. Beside
          challenging myself, I love learning new technologies and languages.
        </p>

        <p class="text-grey-5 mt-4">
          My journey began as a Software Engineer, where I worked as an
          Automation Engineer, diving into automation and gradually branching
          out into full-stack development. Over time, my natural interest in art
          and design, along with a curiosity for user interfaces, drew me
          towards frontend development and throughout I have looked towards
          automating tasks like testing, deployment and monitoring.
        </p>

        <p class="text-grey-5 mt-4">
          I moved to the Netherlands to start a new chapter alongside my
          husband. It has been filled with exploration, travel, and the thrill
          of working on my portfolio. Iâ€™m eager to continue growing my skills,
          collaborating, and work on challenging projects that truly resonate.
